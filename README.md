### Structure
*  Leg Structure:
   - The leg is represented as a vertical rectangular structure
*  Joint Mechanism:
   - There are 3 joint positions located along the leg structure
* Servo Motor Control:
   - A total of 6 servo motors are required, with 3 motors per leg.
   - Each servo motor is responsible for actuating one of the 3 joints in the leg structure.
   - By controlling the rotation and angle of each servo motor, the leg can be positioned and articulated as needed.
